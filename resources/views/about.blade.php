    If your route only needs to return a view, you may use the 
    Route::view method. Like the redirect method, 
    this method provides a simple shortcut so that you do not have 
    to define a full route or controller. The view method accepts a URI 
    as its first argument and a view name as its second argument. 
    In addition, you may provide an array of data to pass to the view as an 
    optional third argument:
    </div>
